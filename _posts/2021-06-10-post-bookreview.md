<b>Origin</b> by Dan Brown<br>
Gem of a book. It is pacy thriller revolving around the murder of its main protagonist, Edmond Kirsch.<br>
<b>Crime and Punishment</b> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky<br>
Psycho thriller, vintage and a must read. Can be a bit confusing due to the Russian characters' name but story plot holds you throughout.<br>
<b>Meditations</b> by Marcus Aurelius.<br>
