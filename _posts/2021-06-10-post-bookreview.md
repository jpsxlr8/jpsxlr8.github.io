<b>Origin</b> by Dan Brown<br>
Gem of a book. It is pacy thriller revolving around the murder of its main protagonist, Edmond Kirsch.<br>
<b>Crime and Punishment</b> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky<br>
Psycho thriller, vintage and a must read. Can be a bit confusing due to the Russian names but story plot holds you throughout.<br>
<b>Meditations</b> by Marcus Aurelius.<br>
<b>Psychology of Money</b> by Morgan Housel<br>
Very well written with easy to understandable concepts. Must read if you want to be well versed with finance lingos.<br>
<b>Deep Work</b> by Cal Newport<br>
Interesting read outlining the benefits of deep work i.e deliberte work done with full concentration without any distractions. <br>
<b>Fooled by Randomness</b> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb<br>
 A one time read since the book is fulled of blabbery in pursuit to press the author's viewpoint. <br>
