    <h1>What Creates Success?</h1>
    <p>Conclusion from the above table</p>
    <p>First talk about which profession is the most noble and contributes greatly than others.Is it teacher or painter or politician or entrpreneur or engineer or doctor or an bureaucrat? Well, theirs' no definite answer to this question since every profession had its pros and cons. Its very difficult to pin point one answer to this, but considering the grand scheme of things and as an aware homo-sapiens,I think we can trim down to one. <br>According to me, researchers/scientists are the people who contributes most to the society. They are the people who moves the human race forward. Dedicating their life to experiments, they pave the way for development of science. They're the artists in real sense working day-by-day on their craft to create genius.And thats where the true success lies.  </p>
    <ul>
        <p>Here are my two cents which I've gained through this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Out of 30-odd Nobel laureates in Physics between 1900 and 1930 only one laureate's father did something manual for a living.<br><i>**[] in early 19th century being a farm-owner is not that bad considering the living standards of that period.**</i></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Johannes van der Wall's father was a carpenter.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>So what, Kehna kya chahte ho?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The problem is access: money and resources give vastly better access to education and opportunity.</li>
            <li>The problem is ability: intelligence is largely inherited and smart parents will have smart offsprings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Case closed.Keep calm and love Dubstep.</i></p>
