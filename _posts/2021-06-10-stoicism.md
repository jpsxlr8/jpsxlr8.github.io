Cling tooth and nail to the following rule: not to give in to adversity, never to trust prosperity, and always take full note of fortune’s habit of behaving just as she pleases, treating her as if she were actually going to do everything it is in her power to do.

— Seneca

It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.
— Epictetus

Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents.
— Epictetus

If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out this judgment now.
— Marcus Aurelius

You squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last.
― Seneca

Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together.
— Marcus Aurelius
