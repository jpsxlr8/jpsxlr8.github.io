It is total waste of four years.<br>
Outdated Curriculum.<br>
Highly competitive peers.<br>
Lots and lots of mugging.<br>
In fact, JEE is highly overrated.<br>
Engineering college don't have proper infrastructures.<br>
Research is close to zero.<br>
Employee mentality is promoted through quizzes and assignments.<br>
Labs are outdated.<br>
Packages are skewed in favour of software-related streams.<br>
