It is total waste of four years.
Outdated Curriculum.
Highly competitive peers.
Lots and lots of mugging.
In fact, JEE is highly overrated.
Engineering college don't have proper infrastructures.
Research is close to zero.
Employee mentality is promoted through quizzes and assignments.
Labs are outdated.
Packages are skewed in favour of software-related streams.
